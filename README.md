# SQL-Database-Analysis
Worked with the Northwind sample database to perform end-to-end data analysis using SQL. The project focused on extracting meaningful business insights from sales, customers, orders, and products data.
What I did:

Wrote complex SQL queries using JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, and aggregations

Analyzed sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, and product-wise revenue

Identified top customers, high-performing products, and regional trends

Answered real business questions such as revenue contribution, order frequency, and customer value

Strengthened my ability to translate business questions into SQL queries and convert raw database tables into actionable insights.
